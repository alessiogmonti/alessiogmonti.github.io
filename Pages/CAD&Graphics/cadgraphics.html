                Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a broad term for software capable of creating 2D and 3D objects.
                These can be static or fluid, for media, production, prototyping, or simulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A static CAD model is simply a graphic or 3D model that cannot be changed unless elements of its
                structure are directly modified. Fluid CAD models can change programmatically, whether according to a data feed, user-manipulated parameters
                or through algorithmic iteration.
              </p>
              <div class="image1">

              </div>
              <p>
                Engineering-focused programs like Rhino and Autodesk Fusion allow the user to define the logic that
                describes the object. The object is defined by the order of operations selected by the user and in this
                regard, the object can be modified from any point. Non-parametric programs would require you to undo
                your operations until you reach the desired modification point, but conversely are simpler and
                do not require as much planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The advantages of the non-linear model making technique are its flexibility and capacity for iteration.
                Each operation is a mathematical equation that successively manipulates the previous definition, affecting
                the coordinates that make up each point within the curves that define the shape of the object. The
                degree of manipulation is determined by variables within the equation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The variables of these operations are user defined but can also be manipulated programmatically according to
                additional parameters, known as hyper-parameters. These are technically parameters of parameters, and they affect
                the order of operations, the operations selected and the variables within these operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                These hyper-parameters
                are tuned according to feedback from a function that evaluates the model's performance in respect to a particular task,
                while remaining within the bounds set by the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following example illustrates a simple hyper-parametrized model: the thickness of this structure is manipulated by
                an iterative algorithm that is attempting to maximise stress tolerance while minimizing material usage, thereby creating
                the best possible structure in the most cost effective manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                More advanced systems can leverage real time data feeds to forecast future scenarios and adapt to them before they occur.
                This is an example of a wheel adjusting its spoke strength in response to forcasted levels of wear and tear, according to
                generated road models. These predictive models are called digital twins.
